<p><strong>Develop stable, robust and highly versatile software, faster!</strong></p>

<p>Countless hours have been spent by developers writing the same code over and over and over again. It's time to stop this repetitive coding and bring your team to the next level of efficiency.</p>

<p>That's where CodeGenerator comes in. This tool allows you and your team to get the nuts and bolts of any project up and running amazingly fast. The backbone of CodeGenerator relies on technologies that your team probably already knows - XML and XSLT. You design an XSL Template <em>once</em> and CodeGenerator handles the rest. Once you get going you'll be pleasantly surprised by just how much code you can automate! And what's more - you can generate code in any language and for any platform! It's all up to you to decide how you want to architect your templates for the most robust and fool-proof codebase you've ever used.</p>

<p>CodeGenerator is truly going to change the way you write code - for the better. We've used this tool on private projects for years and decided to make it available to everyone.</p>
